# Example 1

## What it does

It detects a hand and produces an image of a plant and makes it shake for couple of seconds.
This is supposed to prototype the interaction between a human and a plant using hand gestures and movements.

## Installation

Run it by opening index.html or using Live Server with VS Code.

To use handtrack.js in your code, include a link in your script tag in the html document.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handtrackjs/dist/handtrack.min.js"> </script>

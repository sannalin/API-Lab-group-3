# Example 1

## What it does

When a hand is detected, a block moves from left to right on the screen, and changes color from blue to red.
This example helped explore movements based on hand detection, and I also built my prototype from this example.
I made the movement smaller to showcase how a plant would move when a hand is detected.

## Installation

Run it by opening index.html or using Live Server with VS Code.

To use handtrack.js in your code, include a link in your script tag in the html document.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handtrackjs/dist/handtrack.min.js"> </script>

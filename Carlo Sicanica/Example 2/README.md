# Example 2

## What it does

Detects the hand and shows the user how the hand detection works in handtrack.js.
It draws a box around the user's hand and alerts when the detection starts.

## Installation

Open index.html to run the code, or open it with VS Code and run it using Live Server.

To include handtrack.js in your code, include it in a script tag in your html.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handtrackjs/dist/handtrack.min.js"> </script>

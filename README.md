# API Lab Prototyping with Handtrack.js

During our design project (an interactive flower pot that will indicate water needs by movement) we have used the [Handtrack.js](https://victordibia.com/handtrack.js/) to explore the possibility of using hand gestures to start an interaction. For our project we want to work with hand movement to initiate the interaction. Handtrack.js gave us the possibility to detect hands in videos and images. We could use it to quickly get started with our prototypes.


# Getting started

Most examples and prototypes can be runned by just opening the `index.html` file. 
For examples that needs installation, see the individual README file.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project

The prototypes and examples are made by Anna Korczak, Carlo Sicanica and Sanna Lindholm. The examples are mainly based on code from one or more of these sources:  

- Handtrack.js - https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/) 
- Code Train - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5tC5nQMRY

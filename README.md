# API Lab repository (group-3)

# Handtrack.js
Handtrack.js library allows you track a userâ€™s hand (bounding box) from an image in any orientation, in 3 lines of code. It allows developers quickly prototype hand/gesture interactions powered by a trained hand detection model.

# What the project does
Our goal is to make it possible to start an interaction with a plant, using hand gesture. The concept is that our special pot has a camera and when the API detects a hand, a plant starts to move, showing its state.

# Why the project is useful
We wanted to explore users' gestures and distance from a plant, which they would naturally use to start an interaction. Since we had only a proximity sensor in mind before, we wanted to explore this area deeper and decide if the hand gestures detection could better contribute to our project.

# How users can get started with the project
How to use your code

# Who maintains and contributes to the project
Handtrack.js is made by Victor Dibia (https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/) and we used his examples as templates for our prototypes. The prototypes are made by Anna Korczak, Carlo Sicanica and Sanna Lindholm.

example:
# Foobar
